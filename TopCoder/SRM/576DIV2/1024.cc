 * Problem Statement
 *     
 * Manao has a matrix X with 10,000 rows and W columns. He likes to fill it with
 * characters; he even has developed an algorithm for this task. First, he
 * chooses a string S consisting of at most W lowercase letters. The string S is
 * called the generator. Then, he applies the algorithm described by the
 * following pseudocode:
 * cur := 0
 * for i := 0 to 9999
 *   for j := 0 to W - 1
 *       X[i][j] := S.charAt(cur)
 *           cur := (cur + 1) mod length(S)
 * Manao has recently found a matrix X in his notepad. He wonders
 * whether it was generated using the above algorithm. You are given:
 * a vector <string> fragment that contains a rectangular submatrix
 * of X,
 * the int W: the width of X,
 * and two ints i0 and j0: the coordinates of the upper left corner
 * of your submatrix within X.
 * In other words, for all valid i, j we have fragment[i][j] = X[i +
 * i0][j + j0]. Count how many different generators Manao could have
 * used to create a matrix X that contains the fragment you were
 * given. Return this number modulo 1,000,000,009.
 *
 * Definition
 *     
 * Class:
 * CharacterBoard2
 * Method:
 * countGenerators
 * Parameters:
 * vector <string>, int, int, int
 * Returns:
 * int
 * Method signature:
 * int countGenerators(vector <string> fragment, int W, int i0, int
 * j0)
 * (be sure your method is public)
 *     
 *
 * Constraints
 * - fragment will contain N elements, where N is between 1 and 10,
 *   inclusive.
 * - Each element of fragment will be M characters long, where M is
 *   between 1 and 10, inclusive.
 * - Each element of fragment will consist of lowercase letters
 *   ('a'-'z') only.
 * - W will be between M and 10,000, inclusive.
 * - i0 will be between 0 and 10,000 - N, inclusive.
 * - j0 will be between 0 and W - M, inclusive.
